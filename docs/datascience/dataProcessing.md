# Data processing

## The goal
Convert the data close to nature, and make more convenient for human  and computer to understand the data.

## Common method
* Data cleaning: process the missing value and wrong data
* Data integration: intergate data from multiple sources.
* Data reduction: vector reduction and value reduction
* Data transformation: standardization, log transformation, discretization
* Data mixing: reduce the problem caused by data order

## Specific method

### Use log transformation to process nonlinear data

In addition, there are power transformation, negative transformation and root transformation, all of which are data transformations.

Log transformation is useful to conver many data multiply to add, which avoid influence of value close to 0. And it is convenient to calculate. 

If you need make 2 and 0.5 has a equal range from 1, using natural logarithm "e" will get a result of 0.69 and -0.69.
